#Quality of Service (QOS); think of it as job priority, there is also --qos=long for with a max job length of 7 days, qos normal is 48 hours.
# REMOVE "normal" and set to "long" if you want your job to run longer than 48 hours,  
# NOTE- in the hns partition the default max run time is 7 days , so you wont need to include qos
 
#SBATCH --qos=normal

# We are submitting to the dev partition, there are several on sherlock: normal, gpu, owners, hns, bigmem (jobs requiring >64Gigs RAM)

#SBATCH -p normal

#number of nodes you are requesting, the more you ask for the longer you wait
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#################
# --mem is memory per node; default is 4000 MB per CPU, remember to ask for enough mem to match your CPU request, since 
# sherlock automatically allocates 8 Gigs of RAM/CPU, if you ask for 8 CPUs you will need 32 Gigs of RAM, so either 
# leave --mem commented out or request >= to the RAM needed for your CPU request.
