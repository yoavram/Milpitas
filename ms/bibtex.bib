 abstract = {The concept of genetic relatedness is central to the sociobiological theory of kinship altruism. Genes which code for altruistic acts toward closely related genetic kin can overcome selection pressures favoring self-interested behavior. But genetic relatedness declines rapidly as kinship becomes more distant, thereby restricting genetically-based altruism to very close kin. This paper extends these notions to cultural relatedness, arguing that oblique and horizontal transmission can yield high levels of cultural relatedness in larger groups. A mathematical model of cultural transmission is proposed, and equilibria for several special cases are investigated. For all models, the equilibrium level of relatedness is critically dependent on the influence of exogenous sources. In models with equal influence of nonparents, the level of relatedness varies inversely with group size. On the other hand, when nonparental influence is concentrated on a single individual, the level of relatedness does not vary with group size. ?? 1991.},

 abstract = {Cultural variation in a population is affected by the rate of occurrence of cultural innovations, whether such innovations are preferred or eschewed, how they are transmitted between individuals in the population, and the size of the population. An innovation, such as a modification in an attribute of a handaxe, may be lost or may become a property of all handaxes, which we call "fixation of the innovation." Alternatively, several innovations may attain appreciable frequencies, in which case properties of the frequency distribution-for example, of handaxe measurements-is important. Here we apply the Moran model from the stochastic theory of population genetics to study the evolution of cultural innovations. We obtain the probability that an initially rare innovation becomes fixed, and the expected time this takes. When variation in cultural traits is due to recurrent innovation, copy error, and sampling from generation to generation, we describe properties of this variation, such as the level of heterogeneity expected in the population. For all of these, we determine the effect of the mode of social transmission: conformist, where there is a tendency for each na{\"{i}}ve newborn to copy the most popular variant; pro-novelty bias, where the newborn prefers a specific variant if it exists among those it samples; one-to-many transmission, where the variant one individual carries is copied by all newborns while that individual remains alive. We compare our findings with those predicted by prevailing theories for rates of cultural change and the distribution of cultural variation.},

 abstract = {Phenotypic adaptation to fluctuating environments has been an important focus in the population genetic literature. Previous studies have shown that evolution under temporal variation is determined not only by expected fitness in a given generation, but also by the degree of variation in fitness over generations; in an uncertain environment, alleles that increase the geometric mean fitness can invade a randomly mating population at equilibrium. This geometric mean principle governs the evolutionary interplay of genes controlling mean phenotype and genes controlling phenotypic variation, such as genetic regulators of the epigenetic machinery. Thus, it establishes an important role for stochastic epigenetic variation in adaptation to fluctuating environments: by modifying the geometric mean fitness, variance-modifying genes can change the course of evolution and determine the long-term trajectory of the evolving system. The role of phenotypic variance has previously been studied in systems in which the only driving force is natural selection, and there is no recombination between mean- and variance-modifying genes. Here, we develop a population genetic model to investigate the effect of recombination between mean- and variance-modifiers of phenotype on the geometric mean principle under different environmental regimes and fitness landscapes. We show that interactions of recombination with stochastic epigenetic variation and environmental fluctuations can give rise to complex evolutionary dynamics that differ from those in systems with no recombination.},

 abstract = {In the classical theory of biometrical genetics, the genotype determines the phenotype of an individual, the effect of the environment is not recognized as a dynamic factor. The concept that the phenotype is the result of development of an individual in a certain environment and that the genotype provides the mode of reaction, but the environment provides the challenges and the conditions of development, is basic to genetic thinking; but in the classical models of biometrical genetics the representation of this interaction is usually absent or limited to the evaluation of genotypic environment interaction variances. In experimental situations, such as are possible with plants and animals, the classical model may usually suffice. The simplicity of the model is then still adequate because suitable experimental designs can help minimize or evaluate genotype environment interactions. In nonexperimental situations, as are usual in man, this approach seems unsatisfactory especially for behavioral traits, where it is clear that the phenotype is the consequence of a long and complex learning process. Formalization of the contribution of cultural transmission to a trait is possible, and the authors investigated the consequences of parent offspring cultural transmission. Their model also includes genetic variation of various kinds. It thus encompasses a variety of models, from one extreme of pure cultural transmission to the other of pure biological transmission. This last model is that of classical biometrical genetics. The major hope of analysis of real data comes from the parallel study of covariances of adoptive and biological relatives. Even through this method has practical limitations, ot is basic to a proper understanding if inheritance, especially for behavioral traits.},

 abstract = {Birdsong is a complex cultural and biological system, and the selective forces driving evolutionary changes in aspects of song learning vary considerably among species. The extent to which repertoire size, the number of syllables or song types sung by a bird, is subject to sexual selection is unknown, and studies to date have provided inconsistent evidence. Here, we propose that selection pressure on the size and complexity of birdsong repertoires may facilitate the construction of a niche in which learning, sexual selection, and song-based homophily may co-evolve. We show, using a review of the birdsong literature and mathematical modeling, that learning mode (open-ended or closed-ended learning) is correlated with the size of birdsong repertoires. Underpinning this correlation may be a form of cultural niche construction in which a costly biological trait (for example, open-ended learning) can spread in a population (or be lost) as a result of direct selection on an associated cultural trait (for example, song repertoire size).

 abstract = {Evolution of mutation rate controlled by a neutral modifier is studied for a locus with two alleles under temporally fluctuating selection pressure. A general formula is derived to calculate the evolutionarily stable mutation rate mu(ess) in an infinitely large haploid population, and following results are obtained. (I) For any fluctuation, periodic or random: (1) if the recombination rate r per generation between the modifier and the main locus is 0, mu(ess) is the same as the optimal mutation rate mu(op) which maximizes the long-term geometric average of population fitness; and (2) for any r, if the strength s of selection per generation is very large, mu(ess) is equal to the reciprocal of the average number T of generations (duration time) during which one allele is persistently favored than the other. (II) For a periodic fluctuation in the limit of small s and r, mu(ess)T is a function of sT and rT with properties: (1) for a given sT, mu(ess)T decreases with increasing rT; (2) for sT {\textless}/= 1, mu(ess)T is almost independent of sT, and depends on rT as mu(ess)T {\&} 1.6 for rT {\textless}{\textless} 1 and mu(ess)T {\&} 6/rT for rT {\textgreater}{\textgreater} 1; and (3) for sT {\textgreater}/= 1, and for a given rT, mu(ess)T decreases with increasing sT to a certain minimum less than 1, and then increases to 1 asymptotically in the limit of large sT. (III) For a fluctuation consisting of multiple Fourier components (i.e., sine wave components), the component with the longest period is the most effective in determining mu(ess) (low pass filter effect). (IV) When the cost c of preventing mutation is positive, the modifier is nonneutral, and mu(ess) becomes larger than in the case of neutral modifier under the same selection pressure acting at the main locus. The value of c which makes mu(ess) equal to mu(op) of the neutral modifier case is calculated. It is argued that this value gives a critical cost such that, so long as the actual cost exceeds this value, the evolution rate at the main locus must be smaller than its mutation rate mu(ess).},

We calculate the conditions required for the evolution of phenotypic switching as a form of bet-hedging as a function of the population size N, the rate ?? at which a rare environment is encountered, and the selective advantage s associated with switching in the rare environment. We consider a simplified model in which environmental switching and phenotypic switching are one-way processes, and mutation is symmetric and rare with respect to the timescale of fixation events.

 abstract = {Much existing literature in anthropology suggests that teaching is rare in non-Western societies, and that cultural transmission is mostly vertical (parent-to-offspring). However, applications of evolutionary theory to humans predict both teaching and non-vertical transmission of culturally learned skills, behaviors, and knowledge should be common cross-culturally. Here, we review this body of theory to derive predictions about when teaching and non-vertical transmission should be adaptive, and thus more likely to be observed empirically. Using three interviews conducted with rural Fijian populations, we find that parents are more likely to teach than are other kin types, high-skill and highly valued domains are more likely to be taught, and oblique transmission is associated with high-skill domains, which are learned later in life. Finally, we conclude that the apparent conflict between theory and empirical evidence is due to a mismatch of theoretical hypotheses and empirical claims across disciplines, and we reconcile theory with the existing literature in light of our results.

For the simplest case, the optimal spontaneous transition rate between two states is approximately 1/n (where n is the cycle length). It is also shown that selection for the optimal transition rate under these conditions is surprisingly strong. When n is small, this means that the heritable variations are produced by non-classical inheritance systems, including non-DNA inheritance systems. Thus, it is predicted that in genes controlling adaptation to such environments, non-classical genetic effects are likely to be observed. We argue that the evolution of spontaneous and induced heritable transitions played an important role in the evolution of ontogenies of both unicellular and multicellular organisms. The existence of a machinery for producing induced heritable phenotypic variations introduces a "Lamarckian" factor into evolution.},

 abstract = {Social insects are important models for social evolution and behavior. However, in many species, experimental control over important factors that regulate division of labor, such as genotype and age, is limited [1, 2]. Furthermore, most species have fixed queen and worker castes, making it difficult to establish causality between the molecular mechanisms that underlie reproductive division of labor, the hallmark of insect societies [3]. Here we present the genome of the queenless clonal raider ant Cerapachys biroi, a powerful new study system that does not suffer from these constraints. Using cytology and RAD-seq, we show that C. biroi reproduces via automixis with central fusion and that heterozygosity is lost extremely slowly. As a consequence, nestmates are almost clonally related (r = 0.996). Workers in C. biroi colonies synchronously alternate between reproduction and brood care, and young workers eclose in synchronized cohorts. We show that genes associated with division of labor in other social insects are conserved in C. biroi and dynamically regulated during the colony cycle. With unparalleled experimental control over an individual's genotype and age, and the ability to induce reproduction and brood care [4, 5], C. biroi has great potential to illuminate the molecular regulation of division of labor. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Liberman2011,
 abstract = {Phenotypic switching has been observed in laboratory studies of yeast and bacteria, in which the rate of such switching appears to adjust to match the frequency of environmental changes. Among possible mechanisms of switching are epigenetic influences on gene expression and variation in levels of methylation; thus environmental and/or genetic factors may contribute to the rate of switching. Most previous analyses of the evolution of phenotypic switching have compared exponential growth rates of noninteracting populations, and recombination has been ignored. Our genetic model of the evolution of switching rates is framed in terms of a mutation-modifying gene, environments that cause periodic changes in fitness, and recombination between the mutation modifier and the gene under selection. Exact results are obtained for all recombination rates and symmetric fitnesses that strongly generalize earlier results obtained under complete linkage and strong constraints on the relation between fitness and period of switching. Our analytical and numerical results suggest a general principle that recombination reduces the stable rate of switching in symmetric and asymmetric fitness regimes and when the period of switching is random. As the recombination rate increases, it becomes less likely that there is a stable nonzero rate of switching.},

@article{McElreath2008,
 abstract = {It is commonly assumed that parents are important sources of socially learned behavior and beliefs. However, the empirical evidence that parents are cultural models is ambiguous, and debates continue over their importance. A formal theory that examines the evolution of psychological tendencies to imitate parents (vertical transmission) and to imitate nonparent adults (oblique transmission) in stochastic fluctuating environments points to forces that sometimes make vertical transmission adaptive, but oblique transmission recovers more quickly from rapid environmental change. These results suggest that neither mode of transmission should be expected to dominate the other across all domains. Vertical transmission may be preferred when (1) learned behavior affects fertility rather than survival to adulthood, (2) the relevant environment is stable, or (3) selection is strong. For those interested in the evolution of social learning in diverse taxa, these models provide predictions for use in comparative studies.},

In seeking to answer fundamental questions about how biological systems function and change over time, the modern biologist is as likely to rely on sophisticated mathematical and computer-based models as traditional fieldwork. In this book, Sarah Otto and Troy Day provide biology students with the tools necessary to both interpret models and to build their own.The book starts at an elementary level of mathematical modeling, assuming that the reader has had high school mathematics and first-year calculus. Otto and Day then gradually build in depth and complexity, from classic models in ecology and evolution to more intricate class-structured and probabilistic models. The authors provide primers with instructive exercises to introduce readers to the more advanced subjects of linear algebra and probability theory. Through examples, they describe how models have been used to understand such topics as the spread of HIV, chaos, the age structure of a country, speciation, and extinction.Ecologists and evolutionary biologists today need enough mathematical training to be able to assess the power and limits of biological models and to develop theories and models themselves. This innovative book will be an indispensable guide to the world of mathematical models for the next generation of biologists.A how-to guide for developing new mathematical models in biologyProvides step-by-step recipes for constructing and analyzing modelsInteresting biological applicationsExplores classical models in ecology and evolutionQuestions at the end of every chapterPrimers cover important mathematical topicsExercises with answersAppendixes summarize useful rulesLabs and advanced material available},

Researchers have hypothesized that, unlike biological transmission, cultural transmission occurs through at least three different, non-mutually exclusive paths: (1) from parents (vertical); (2) from age peers (horizontal); and (3) from older generations (oblique). We used data from 270 adults in a society in the Bolivian Amazon to estimate the association between a person's knowledge and skills and the knowledge and skills of the (1) same-sex parent, (2) age peers (or individuals born in the same village as the subject within ??4 years of the subject's year of birth), and (3) parental cohort (excluding parents). We found a statistically significant association between personal and parental and old cohort knowledge. The magnitude of the association is larger for old cohort knowledge than for parental knowledge, suggesting that, for the studied population, the transmission of ethnobotanical knowledge and skills is mostly oblique. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Multicellular organisms can no longer be considered individuals by the classical definitions of the term. Every natural animal and plant is a holobiont consisting of the host and diverse symbiotic microbes and viruses. Microbial symbionts can be transmitted from parent to offspring by a variety of methods, including via cytoplasmic inheritance, coprophagy, direct contact during and after birth, and the environment. A large number of studies have demonstrated that these symbionts contribute to the anatomy, physiology, development, innate and adaptive immunity, and behavior and finally also to genetic variation and to the origin and evolution of species. Acquisition of microbes and microbial genes is a powerful mechanism for driving the evolution of complexity. Evolution proceeds both via cooperation and competition, working in parallel.},

 abstract = {Uncertain environments pose a tremendous challenge to populations: The selective pressures imposed by the environment can change so rapidly that adaptation by mutation alone would be too slow. One solution to this problem is given by the phenomenon of stochastic phenotype switching, which causes genetically uniform populations to be phenotypically heterogenous. Stochastic phenotype switching has been observed in numerous microbial species and is generally assumed to be an adaptive bet-hedging strategy to anticipate future environmental change. We use an explicit population genetic model to investigate the evolutionary dynamics of phenotypic switching rates. We find that whether or not stochastic switching is an adaptive strategy is highly contingent upon the fitness landscape given by the changing environment. Unless selection is very strong, asymmetric fitness landscapes-where the cost of being maladapted is not identical in all environments-strongly select against stochastic switching. We further observe a threshold phenomenon that causes switching rates to be either relatively high or completely absent, but rarely intermediate. Our finding that marginal changes in selection pressures can cause fundamentally different evolutionary outcomes is important in a wide range of fields concerned with microbial bet hedging.},

@article{Serobyan2013,
 abstract = {The increasing evidence for a role of develop- mental plasticity in evolution offers exciting prospects for testing interactions between ecological and developmental genetic processes. Recent advances with the model organism Pristionchus pacificus have provided inroads to a mechanistic understanding of a developmental plasticity. The develop- mental plasticity of P. pacificus comprises two discontinuous adult mouth‐forms, a stenostomatous (“narrow mouthed”) and a eurystomatous (“wide mouthed”) form, the latter of which is structurally more complex and associated with predatory feeding. Both forms are consistently present in populations, but fundamental properties guiding fluctuations in their appearance have been poorly understood. Here, we provide a systematic characterization of the mouth plasticity in P. INTRODUCTION The ability of a single genotype to exhibit major phenotypic differences is becoming increasingly recognized as a driver of novelty and the diversity of form (West‐Eberhard 2003). The link between polyphenism and evolution is supported by numerous case studies, as highlighted in several recent reviews (Fusco and Minelli 2010; Moczek 2010; Pfennig et al. 2010; Moczek et al. 2011). It has been argued that developmental plasticity facilitates morphological innovations that result in new traits and, simultaneously, allow for novel interactions in the environment (West‐Eberhard 2003). Beyond this theoretical framework developed for understanding the role of develop- mental plasticity in the origin of new traits, experimental evidence has revealed some specific genetic mechanisms that are involved in the accommodation of polyphenic traits (Suzuki and Nijhout 2006) or are associated with their expression (Braendle et al. 2005; Snell‐Rood and Moczek 2012). In the nematode Pristionchus pacificus, plasticity of feeding structures was coupled with known developmental pathways (Bento et al. 2010). The polyphenism of P. pacificus, as in other species of the family Diplogastridae, consists of a stenostom- pacificus, quantifying a strong sexual dimorphism and revealing that, in an inbred genetic background, maternal phenotype is linked to that of male offspring. Furthermore, cues from conspecifics influenced the developmental decision in juvenile nematodes. Separating individuals from a popula- tion resulted in a lower eurystomatous frequency, which decreased incrementally with earlier isolation. Finally, the time to the reproductively mature stage was, in the presence of an abundant bacterial food supply, less for stenostomatous than for eurystomatous individuals, suggesting the potential for a fitness trade‐off between developmental time and breadth of diet. This study provides a baseline understanding of the mouth dimorphism in P. pacificus as a necessary reference point for comparative analysis.},

@article{Tehrani2009,
 abstract = {It is often assumed that parent-to-child cultural transmission leads to similarities and differences among groups evolving through descent with modification ("phylogenesis"). Similarly, cultural transmission between peers, and between adults and children who are not their offspring, is widely believed to result in groups exchanging cultural traits ("ethnogenesis"). However, neither of these assumptions has been examined empirically. Here, we test them using ethnographic data on craft learning in Iranian tribal populations and the cladistic method of phylogenetic analysis. We find that parent-to-child transmission dominates learning during childhood, but the other two forms of interindividual transmission become more important in later periods. The latter do not, however, appear to have resulted in extensive exchange of cultural traits among tribes. Instead we find that most of the variation among the tribes' craft assemblages can be explained by descent with modification. This can be accounted for by the fact that weavers usually only share their knowledge with members of their own tribe and are prevented from interacting with women from other groups by social norms. These findings demonstrate that the relationship between processes of cultural evolution at the level of the individual and processes of cultural evolution at the level of the group is more complex than is usually acknowledged, and highlight the need for more integrated studies of the processes operating at both scales. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

When should this vocabulary be applied? Are these concepts a null hypothesis for host-microbe systems or limited to a certain spectrum of symbiotic interactions such as host-microbial coevolution? Critical discourse is necessary in this nascent area, but productive discourse requires that skeptics and proponents use the same lexicon. For instance, critiquing the hologenome concept is not synonymous with critiquing coevolution, and arguing that an entity is not a primary unit of selection dismisses the fact that the hologenome concept has always embraced multilevel selection. Holobionts and hologenomes are incontrovertible, multipartite entities that result from ecological, evolutionary, and genetic processes at various levels.

@article{Waters2005,
 abstract = {Bacteria communicate with one another using chemical signal molecules. As in higher organisms, the information supplied by these molecules is critical for synchronizing the activities of large groups of cells. In bacteria, chemical communication involves producing, releasing, detecting, and responding to small hormone-like molecules termed autoinducers . This process, termed quorum sensing, allows bacteria to monitor the environment for other bacteria and to alter behavior on a population-wide scale in response to changes in the number and/or species present in a community. Most quorum-sensing-controlled processes are unproductive when undertaken by an individual bacterium acting alone but become beneficial when carried out simultaneously by a large number of cells. Thus, quorum sensing confuses the distinction between prokaryotes and eukaryotes because it enables bacteria to act as multicellular organisms. This review focuses on the architectures of bacterial chemical communication networks; how chemical information is integrated, processed, and transduced to control gene expression; how intra- and interspecies cell-cell communication is accomplished; and the intriguing possibility of prokaryote-eukaryote cross-communication.},

@book{Whitehead2014,
 abstract = {In the songs and bubble feeding of humpback whales; in young killer whales learning to knock a seal from an ice floe in the same way their mother does; and in the use of sea sponges by the dolphins of Shark Bay, Australia, to protect their beaks while foraging for fish, we find clear examples of the transmission of information among cetaceans. Just as human cultures pass on languages and turns of phrase, tastes in food (and in how it is acquired), and modes of dress, could whales and dolphins have developed a culture of their very own? Unequivocally: yes. In The Cultural Lives of Whales and Dolphins, cetacean biologists Hal Whitehead, who has spent much of his life on the ocean trying to understand whales, and Luke Rendell, whose research focuses on the evolution of social learning, open an astounding porthole onto the fascinating culture beneath the waves. As Whitehead and Rendell show, cetacean culture and its transmission are shaped by a blend of adaptations, innate sociality, and the unique environment in which whales and dolphins live: a watery world in which a hundred-and-fifty-ton blue whale can move with utter grace, and where the vertical expanse is as vital, and almost as vast, as the horizontal. Drawing on their own research as well as a scientific literature as immense as the sea—including evolutionary biology, animal behavior, ecology, anthropology, psychology, and neuroscience—Whitehead and Rendell dive into realms both humbling and enlightening as they seek to define what cetacean culture is, why it exists, and what it means for the future of whales and dolphins. And, ultimately, what it means for our future, as well.},

A single protein sequence can be the basis for many prion strains/variants, with different biological properties based on different amyloid conformations, each rather stably propagating. Prions are unique in that evolution and selection work at both the level of the chromosomal gene encoding the protein, and on the prion itself selecting prion variants. Here, we summarize what is known about the evolution of prion proteins, both the genes and the prions themselves. We contrast the one known functional prion, [Het-s] of Podospora anserina, with the known disease prions, the yeast prions [PSI+] and [URE3] and the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies of mammals.},

@article{Zilber-Rosenberg2008,
 abstract = {We present here the hologenome theory of evolution, which considers the holobiont (the animal or plant with all of its associated microorganisms) as a unit of selection in evolution. The hologenome is defined as the sum of the genetic information of the host and its microbiota. The theory is based on four generalizations: (1) All animals and plants establish symbiotic relationships with microorganisms. (2) Symbiotic microorganisms are transmitted between generations. (3) The association between host and symbionts affects the fitness of the holobiont within its environment. (4) Variation in the hologenome can be brought about by changes in either the host or the microbiota genomes; under environmental stress, the symbiotic microbial community can change rapidly. These points taken together suggest that the genetic wealth of diverse microbial symbionts can play an important role both in adaptation and in evolution of higher organisms. During periods of rapid changes in the environment, the diverse microbial symbiont community can aid the holobiont in surviving, multiplying and buying the time necessary for the host genome to evolve. The distinguishing feature of the hologenome theory is that it considers all of the diverse microbiota associated with the animal or the plant as part of the evolving holobiont. Thus, the hologenome theory fits within the framework of the 'superorganism' proposed by Wilson and Sober.},
 annote = {(1) all animals and plants establish symbiotic relationships with diverse microorganisms.
(2) Symbiotic microorgan- isms can be transmitted between generations with fidelity.
(3) The association between host organism and its microbial community affects the fitness of the holobiont within its environment.
(4) Genetic variation in holobionts can be enhanced by incorporating different symbiont populations and can change under environmental demand more rapidly and by more processes than the genetic information en- coded by the host organism alone.


(1) The diversity of microbial species associated with a particu- lar animal or plant species is high (Table 1)
(2) The host- associated microbial community is very different from the community in the surrounding environment (Chelius
(3) In some cases it has been shown that similar, but not identical, microbial populations are found on the same species that are geographically separated, while different populations are found on different species at the same location
(4) Different microbial communities often dominate different tissues of the same organism
(5) In several cases where a large diversity of associated bacterial species exists, certain bacterial groups dominate.


McFall-Ngai (2002), in an insightful review on the influence of bacteria on animal development, divided the modes for maintaining symbionts faithfully between generations into two categories, trans- ovarian and environmental transmissions, while correctly acknowledging that there are numerous intermediate cases.},
