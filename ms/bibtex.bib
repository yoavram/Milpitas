 abstract = {Phenotypic adaptation to fluctuating environments has been an important focus in the population genetic literature. Previous studies have shown that evolution under temporal variation is determined not only by expected fitness in a given generation, but also by the degree of variation in fitness over generations; in an uncertain environment, alleles that increase the geometric mean fitness can invade a randomly mating population at equilibrium. This geometric mean principle governs the evolutionary interplay of genes controlling mean phenotype and genes controlling phenotypic variation, such as genetic regulators of the epigenetic machinery. Thus, it establishes an important role for stochastic epigenetic variation in adaptation to fluctuating environments: by modifying the geometric mean fitness, variance-modifying genes can change the course of evolution and determine the long-term trajectory of the evolving system. The role of phenotypic variance has previously been studied in systems in which the only driving force is natural selection, and there is no recombination between mean- and variance-modifying genes. Here, we develop a population genetic model to investigate the effect of recombination between mean- and variance-modifiers of phenotype on the geometric mean principle under different environmental regimes and fitness landscapes. We show that interactions of recombination with stochastic epigenetic variation and environmental fluctuations can give rise to complex evolutionary dynamics that differ from those in systems with no recombination.},

 abstract = {In the classical theory of biometrical genetics, the genotype determines the phenotype of an individual, the effect of the environment is not recognized as a dynamic factor. The concept that the phenotype is the result of development of an individual in a certain environment and that the genotype provides the mode of reaction, but the environment provides the challenges and the conditions of development, is basic to genetic thinking; but in the classical models of biometrical genetics the representation of this interaction is usually absent or limited to the evaluation of genotypic environment interaction variances. In experimental situations, such as are possible with plants and animals, the classical model may usually suffice. The simplicity of the model is then still adequate because suitable experimental designs can help minimize or evaluate genotype environment interactions. In nonexperimental situations, as are usual in man, this approach seems unsatisfactory especially for behavioral traits, where it is clear that the phenotype is the consequence of a long and complex learning process. Formalization of the contribution of cultural transmission to a trait is possible, and the authors investigated the consequences of parent offspring cultural transmission. Their model also includes genetic variation of various kinds. It thus encompasses a variety of models, from one extreme of pure cultural transmission to the other of pure biological transmission. This last model is that of classical biometrical genetics. The major hope of analysis of real data comes from the parallel study of covariances of adoptive and biological relatives. Even through this method has practical limitations, ot is basic to a proper understanding if inheritance, especially for behavioral traits.},

 abstract = {Birdsong is a complex cultural and biological system, and the selective forces driving evolutionary changes in aspects of song learning vary considerably among species. The extent to which repertoire size, the number of syllables or song types sung by a bird, is subject to sexual selection is unknown, and studies to date have provided inconsistent evidence. Here, we propose that selection pressure on the size and complexity of birdsong repertoires may facilitate the construction of a niche in which learning, sexual selection, and song-based homophily may co-evolve. We show, using a review of the birdsong literature and mathematical modeling, that learning mode (open-ended or closed-ended learning) is correlated with the size of birdsong repertoires. Underpinning this correlation may be a form of cultural niche construction in which a costly biological trait (for example, open-ended learning) can spread in a population (or be lost) as a result of direct selection on an associated cultural trait (for example, song repertoire size).

 abstract = {Much existing literature in anthropology suggests that teaching is rare in non-Western societies, and that cultural transmission is mostly vertical (parent-to-offspring). However, applications of evolutionary theory to humans predict both teaching and non-vertical transmission of culturally learned skills, behaviors, and knowledge should be common cross-culturally. Here, we review this body of theory to derive predictions about when teaching and non-vertical transmission should be adaptive, and thus more likely to be observed empirically. Using three interviews conducted with rural Fijian populations, we find that parents are more likely to teach than are other kin types, high-skill and highly valued domains are more likely to be taught, and oblique transmission is associated with high-skill domains, which are learned later in life. Finally, we conclude that the apparent conflict between theory and empirical evidence is due to a mismatch of theoretical hypotheses and empirical claims across disciplines, and we reconcile theory with the existing literature in light of our results.

@article{Laland2014,
 abstract = {Social insects are important models for social evolution and behavior. However, in many species, experimental control over important factors that regulate division of labor, such as genotype and age, is limited [1, 2]. Furthermore, most species have fixed queen and worker castes, making it difficult to establish causality between the molecular mechanisms that underlie reproductive division of labor, the hallmark of insect societies [3]. Here we present the genome of the queenless clonal raider ant Cerapachys biroi, a powerful new study system that does not suffer from these constraints. Using cytology and RAD-seq, we show that C. biroi reproduces via automixis with central fusion and that heterozygosity is lost extremely slowly. As a consequence, nestmates are almost clonally related (r = 0.996). Workers in C. biroi colonies synchronously alternate between reproduction and brood care, and young workers eclose in synchronized cohorts. We show that genes associated with division of labor in other social insects are conserved in C. biroi and dynamically regulated during the colony cycle. With unparalleled experimental control over an individual's genotype and age, and the ability to induce reproduction and brood care [4, 5], C. biroi has great potential to illuminate the molecular regulation of division of labor. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Liberman2011,
 abstract = {Phenotypic switching has been observed in laboratory studies of yeast and bacteria, in which the rate of such switching appears to adjust to match the frequency of environmental changes. Among possible mechanisms of switching are epigenetic influences on gene expression and variation in levels of methylation; thus environmental and/or genetic factors may contribute to the rate of switching. Most previous analyses of the evolution of phenotypic switching have compared exponential growth rates of noninteracting populations, and recombination has been ignored. Our genetic model of the evolution of switching rates is framed in terms of a mutation-modifying gene, environments that cause periodic changes in fitness, and recombination between the mutation modifier and the gene under selection. Exact results are obtained for all recombination rates and symmetric fitnesses that strongly generalize earlier results obtained under complete linkage and strong constraints on the relation between fitness and period of switching. Our analytical and numerical results suggest a general principle that recombination reduces the stable rate of switching in symmetric and asymmetric fitness regimes and when the period of switching is random. As the recombination rate increases, it becomes less likely that there is a stable nonzero rate of switching.},

In seeking to answer fundamental questions about how biological systems function and change over time, the modern biologist is as likely to rely on sophisticated mathematical and computer-based models as traditional fieldwork. In this book, Sarah Otto and Troy Day provide biology students with the tools necessary to both interpret models and to build their own.The book starts at an elementary level of mathematical modeling, assuming that the reader has had high school mathematics and first-year calculus. Otto and Day then gradually build in depth and complexity, from classic models in ecology and evolution to more intricate class-structured and probabilistic models. The authors provide primers with instructive exercises to introduce readers to the more advanced subjects of linear algebra and probability theory. Through examples, they describe how models have been used to understand such topics as the spread of HIV, chaos, the age structure of a country, speciation, and extinction.Ecologists and evolutionary biologists today need enough mathematical training to be able to assess the power and limits of biological models and to develop theories and models themselves. This innovative book will be an indispensable guide to the world of mathematical models for the next generation of biologists.A how-to guide for developing new mathematical models in biologyProvides step-by-step recipes for constructing and analyzing modelsInteresting biological applicationsExplores classical models in ecology and evolutionQuestions at the end of every chapterPrimers cover important mathematical topicsExercises with answersAppendixes summarize useful rulesLabs and advanced material available},

We used data from 270 adults in a society in the Bolivian Amazon to estimate the association between a person's knowledge and skills and the knowledge and skills of the (1) same-sex parent, (2) age peers (or individuals born in the same village as the subject within ??4 years of the subject's year of birth), and (3) parental cohort (excluding parents). We found a statistically significant association between personal and parental and old cohort knowledge.

Every natural animal and plant is a holobiont consisting of the host and diverse symbiotic microbes and viruses. Microbial symbionts can be transmitted from parent to offspring by a variety of methods, including via cytoplasmic inheritance, coprophagy, direct contact during and after birth, and the environment. A large number of studies have demonstrated that these symbionts contribute to the anatomy, physiology, development, innate and adaptive immunity, and behavior and finally also to genetic variation and to the origin and evolution of species. Acquisition of microbes and microbial genes is a powerful mechanism for driving the evolution of complexity. Evolution proceeds both via cooperation and competition, working in parallel.},

@article{Tehrani2009,
 abstract = {It is often assumed that parent-to-child cultural transmission leads to similarities and differences among groups evolving through descent with modification ("phylogenesis"). Similarly, cultural transmission between peers, and between adults and children who are not their offspring, is widely believed to result in groups exchanging cultural traits ("ethnogenesis"). However, neither of these assumptions has been examined empirically. Here, we test them using ethnographic data on craft learning in Iranian tribal populations and the cladistic method of phylogenetic analysis. We find that parent-to-child transmission dominates learning during childhood, but the other two forms of interindividual transmission become more important in later periods. The latter do not, however, appear to have resulted in extensive exchange of cultural traits among tribes. Instead we find that most of the variation among the tribes' craft assemblages can be explained by descent with modification. This can be accounted for by the fact that weavers usually only share their knowledge with members of their own tribe and are prevented from interacting with women from other groups by social norms. These findings demonstrate that the relationship between processes of cultural evolution at the level of the individual and processes of cultural evolution at the level of the group is more complex than is usually acknowledged, and highlight the need for more integrated studies of the processes operating at both scales. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Theis2016,
 abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Given the complexity of host-microbiota symbioses, scientists and philosophers are asking questions at new biological levels of hierarchical organization—what is a holobiont and hologenome? When should this vocabulary be applied? Are these concepts a null hypothesis for host-microbe systems or limited to a certain spectrum of symbiotic interactions such as host-microbial coevolution? Critical discourse is necessary in this nascent area, but productive discourse requires that skeptics and proponents use the same lexicon. For instance, critiquing the hologenome concept is not synonymous with critiquing coevolution, and arguing that an entity is not a primary unit of selection dismisses the fact that the hologenome concept has always embraced multilevel selection. Holobionts and hologenomes are incontrovertible, multipartite entities that result from ecological, evolutionary, and genetic processes at various levels. They are not restricted to one special process but constitute a wider vocabulary and framework for host biology in light of the microbiome.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{Verhoeven2016,
 abstract = {"Epigenetics" is often broadly defined and vaguely used (Bird, 2007). In fact, Adrien Bird has been quoted as saying: "Epigenetics is a useful word if you don't know what's going on - if you do, you use something else" (Ledford 2008). However, many do use the word, epigenetics, and some more narrowly than others. These days, the word is often applied to the study of chemical tags on DNA (such as histone modifications, DNA methylation, and the small RNAs that guide them) that have the potential to affect gene expression in response to developmental and environmental triggers (e.g., Richards, 2011).

@book{Whitehead2014,
 abstract = {In the songs and bubble feeding of humpback whales; in young killer whales learning to knock a seal from an ice floe in the same way their mother does; and in the use of sea sponges by the dolphins of Shark Bay, Australia, to protect their beaks while foraging for fish, we find clear examples of the transmission of information among cetaceans. Just as human cultures pass on languages and turns of phrase, tastes in food (and in how it is acquired), and modes of dress, could whales and dolphins have developed a culture of their very own? Unequivocally: yes. In The Cultural Lives of Whales and Dolphins, cetacean biologists Hal Whitehead, who has spent much of his life on the ocean trying to understand whales, and Luke Rendell, whose research focuses on the evolution of social learning, open an astounding porthole onto the fascinating culture beneath the waves. As Whitehead and Rendell show, cetacean culture and its transmission are shaped by a blend of adaptations, innate sociality, and the unique environment in which whales and dolphins live: a watery world in which a hundred-and-fifty-ton blue whale can move with utter grace, and where the vertical expanse is as vital, and almost as vast, as the horizontal. Drawing on their own research as well as a scientific literature as immense as the sea—including evolutionary biology, animal behavior, ecology, anthropology, psychology, and neuroscience—Whitehead and Rendell dive into realms both humbling and enlightening as they seek to define what cetacean culture is, why it exists, and what it means for the future of whales and dolphins. And, ultimately, what it means for our future, as well.},

@article{Zilber-Rosenberg2008,
 abstract = {We present here the hologenome theory of evolution, which considers the holobiont (the animal or plant with all of its associated microorganisms) as a unit of selection in evolution. The hologenome is defined as the sum of the genetic information of the host and its microbiota. The theory is based on four generalizations: (1) All animals and plants establish symbiotic relationships with microorganisms. (2) Symbiotic microorganisms are transmitted between generations. (3) The association between host and symbionts affects the fitness of the holobiont within its environment. (4) Variation in the hologenome can be brought about by changes in either the host or the microbiota genomes; under environmental stress, the symbiotic microbial community can change rapidly. These points taken together suggest that the genetic wealth of diverse microbial symbionts can play an important role both in adaptation and in evolution of higher organisms. During periods of rapid changes in the environment, the diverse microbial symbiont community can aid the holobiont in surviving, multiplying and buying the time necessary for the host genome to evolve. The distinguishing feature of the hologenome theory is that it considers all of the diverse microbiota associated with the animal or the plant as part of the evolving holobiont. Thus, the hologenome theory fits within the framework of the 'superorganism' proposed by Wilson and Sober.},
 annote = {(1) all animals and plants establish symbiotic relationships with diverse microorganisms.
(2) Symbiotic microorgan- isms can be transmitted between generations with fidelity.
(3) The association between host organism and its microbial community affects the fitness of the holobiont within its environment.
(4) Genetic variation in holobionts can be enhanced by incorporating different symbiont populations and can change under environmental demand more rapidly and by more processes than the genetic information en- coded by the host organism alone.


(1) The diversity of microbial species associated with a particu- lar animal or plant species is high (Table 1)
(2) The host- associated microbial community is very different from the community in the surrounding environment (Chelius
(3) In some cases it has been shown that similar, but not identical, microbial populations are found on the same species that are geographically separated, while different populations are found on different species at the same location
(4) Different microbial communities often dominate different tissues of the same organism
(5) In several cases where a large diversity of associated bacterial species exists, certain bacterial groups dominate.


McFall-Ngai (2002), in an insightful review on the influence of bacteria on animal development, divided the modes for maintaining symbionts faithfully between generations into two categories, trans- ovarian and environmental transmissions, while correctly acknowledging that there are numerous intermediate cases.},
