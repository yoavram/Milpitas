# Model {-}
## Wright-Fisher model
We model evolution of a constant, finite size population with non-overlapping generations using a Wright-Fisher model  with natural selection, inheritance, and random genetic drift. This model is based on the simulation description in the final paragraph of the _Materials & Methods_ section of @Xue2016. Indeed, a simulation based on this model (<https://github.com/yoavram/Milpitas>) allowed us to reproduce Figure 2 of @Xue2016 ([@Fig:figure2_reproduction]).

Parameters: _N_=100,000, # generations = 100, $\eta$=0.1, $W$=2, $w$=0.2.](figures/figure2_reproduction.pdf){#fig:figure2_reproduction}

### Definitions

- N: constant population size.
- $\phi_i$: phenotype of individual _i_, $1 \le i \le N, \phi_i \in \{A,B\}$.
- $\epsilon_t$: the environment at generation _t_, $\epsilon_t \in \{A, B\}$.
- $W$: individual fitness when phenotype and environment match, $\phi_i = \epsilon_t$.
- $w$: individual fitness when phenotype and environment do not match, $\phi_i \ne \epsilon_t$.
- $\omega_i$: fitness of individual _i_ at time _t_, $\omega_i=W \cdot 1_{\phi_i = \epsilon_t} + w \cdot 1_{\phi_i \ne \epsilon_t}$.
- $\bar{\omega}$: population mean fitness.
- $\pi_i$: phenotype probability, the probability that individual $i$ becomes phenotype _A_, $1 \le i \le N$.
- $\Pi$: set of phenotype probabilities in the population, $\Pi = \{ \pi_i \}_{1 \le i \le N}$
- $\eta$:  phenotypic inheritance rate, $0 \le \eta \le 1$.

### Reproduction 

For each offspring in the population of generation _t+1_ we choose a parent from the population of generation _t_ and this choice depends on the parent relative fitness: the probability that individual _i_ is the parent is relative to its fitness, $\omega_i$. Therefore, reproduction is modeled by a multinomial distribution. Therefore, reproduction includes the effects of natural selection and random genetic drift.

### Inheritance

The offspring inherits the phenotype probability of the parent with a modification -- if the parent became _A_, then the offspring is even more likely to be _A_; if the parent was _B_, then the offspring is less likely to be _A_. Specifically, for parent _k_ and offspring _i_:

$$
\pi_i = \pi_k \cdot (1-\eta) + \eta \cdot 1_{\phi_k=A}
$$ {#eq:learning_rule}

#### Note
The notation in [@Eq:learning_rule] is different from Eq. 1 in @Xue2016, as _i_ denotes individual, rather than phenotype. But the process is the same. 

#### Note
The expected difference between parent and offspring phenotype probability is $E[\pi_i - \pi_k | \pi_k] = 0$.

### Iteration

At each generation _t_, $\Pi$ is updated according to the following steps. Initial values can be determined (_i.e._, $\forall i, \; \pi_i=0.5$), or values can be drawn from an initial distribution (_i.e._, $\pi_i \sim TN(0.5, 0.05)$, _TN_ is the truncated normal distribution). In addition, the sequence $\epsilon_t$ is independent of the iteration on $Pi$.

At each generation _t_:

1. **Development**: the phenotypes of all individuals are drawn from corresponding Bernoulli distributions depending on their phenotype probabilities: $P(\phi_i=A)=\pi_i$.
1. **Fitness**: the fitness of all individuals is set: $\omega_i = W \cdot 1_{\phi_i=\epsilon_t}+ w \cdot 1_{\phi_i \ne \epsilon_t}$.
1. **Reproduction**: the number of offspring of each individual, $b_i$, is drawn from a multinomial distribution $MN(N, \{\frac{\omega_i}{\sum_i{\omega_i}}\}_{1 \le i \le N})$, such that 
$$
P(b_1 =x_1, \ldots, b_N=x_N)=\frac{N!}{x_1! \cdot \ldots \cdot x_N!}\cdot \Big(\frac{\omega_1}{\sum_i{\omega_i}}\Big)^{x_1} \cdot \ldots \cdot \Big(\frac{\omega_N}{\sum_i{\omega_i}}\Big)^{x_N}
$$.
1. **Inheritance**: the set of phenotype probabilities of the offspring generation is updated using [@Eq:learning_rule] such that for each $i$, $\Pi$ includes exactly $b_i$ copies of $(\pi_i \cdot (1-\eta) + \eta \cdot 1_{\phi_i=A})$.

#### Note
Only development and reproduction are stochastic; natural selection and drift occur at the reproduction step.

#### Note
If $\eta=0$, $\pi_i \in \{0,1\}$, and $\epsilon_t \equiv A$, then we have a standard single locus bi-allelic selection-drift Wright-Fisher model.

## Recurrence equation

We approximate the Wright-Fisher model using a recurrence equation. This approximation is most suitable when the population is composed of a single lineage -- for example, when selection is extreme and there is a common ancestor.

Define _x_ to be the probability that a random individual in the population is _A_. What is _x'_, the probability that a random offspring of that individual is _A_?

Assuming an "infinite" population undergoing exponential growth, this depends on (i) if the parent was _A_ or _B_, with probabilities _x_ and _1-x_, (ii) on the relative contribution of _A_ and _B_ phenotypes to the next generation in terms of fitness, and (iii) on the probability that offspring of _A_ or _B_ phenotypes eventually become _A_, according to the inheritance process ([@Eq:learning_rule]):

$$
x' = x \cdot \frac{\omega_A}{\bar{\omega}} \cdot ((1-\eta)x+\eta) + (1-x) \cdot \frac{\omega_B}{\bar{\omega}} \cdot (1-\eta)x
$$

Where $\omega_A$ and $\omega_B$ are the fitness of phenotypes _A_ and _B_ in the current generation (depending on $\epsilon_t$).

When we write a similar recurrence for the probability that an individual is _B_ ($(1-x)' = F(1-x)$) and sum the two equations, we find that $\bar{\omega} = x \omega_A + (1-x) \omega_B$ is the mean fitness.

This recurrence equation can be reorganized to:

$$
x' = x \frac{x (1-\eta) (\omega_A - \omega_B) + \eta \omega_A + (1-\eta)\omega_B}{x (\omega_A-\omega_B) + \omega_B}
$$ {#eq:recurrence0}

# Results {-}

## Periodic environments

We now concentrate on periodic environments in which both environments occur exactly the same number of generations in each "period". A simple example is _A1B1=ABABABAB..._, in which the environment switches every generation every generation from _A_ to _B_ and vice versa, or _A2B1=AABAABAAB..._ in which the every two _A_s are followed by a single _B_. In general, _AkBl_ denotes an environmental regime in which the period is of length _k+l_ and composed of exactly _k_ _A_s and _l_ _B_s.

We simulated evolution in such environments, and @Fig:env_period_overview shows the evolution of the distribution of $\pi$ in a population evolving in three such environmental regimes.

![Distribution of $\pi$ in populations evolving in periodic environments. **(A)** A1B1, **(B)** A2B1, **(C)** A40B40. Parameters: _N_=100,000, $\eta$=0.01, $W$=1, $w$=0.1.](figures/env_period_overview.pdf){#fig:env_period_overview}

### _A1B1_ regime

When the environment changes every generation, we can write the following recursion, which sets $\omega_A=W, \omega_B=w$ in [@Eq:recurrence0] to determine $x'$ and and then sets $\omega_A=w, \omega_B=W$ to determine $x''$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
x' = x \frac{x (1-\eta) (W-w) + 1 + \eta (W-w)}{x (W-w) + w} \\
x'' = x \frac{x (1-\eta) (w-W) + 1 + \eta (w-W)}{x (w-W) + W}
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq:recurrenceA1B1} 

We are looking for solutions for $x''=x$, which evaluates to a quartic polynomial. Two solutions are $x=0,1$ (assign to [@Eq:recurrenceA1B1] to check), but there are two more potential solutions such that

$$
\begin{aligned}
x''-x = x(1-x)G(x) = 0 \\
G(x) = Ax^2 + Bx + C
\end{aligned}
$$

Using [SymPy](http://sympy.org/), a Python library for symbolic mathematics, a free alternative to Wolfram Mathematicaâ„¢ [@SymPyDevelopmentTeam2014], we find all four solution of $x''-x=0$:

$$
G(x) = x^2 - \frac{W (1-\eta) - w (3-\eta)}{(2-\eta)(W - w)} x - \frac{w}{(2-\eta)(W - w)}
$$ {#eq:recurrenceA1B1_solution}

To find the roots of $G(x)$, recall that $W > w \ge 0, 1 \ge \eta \ge 0$, so
$$
G(0) = \frac{-w}{(2-\eta)(W-w)} < 0
$$
and
$$
\begin{aligned}
G(1) = 1 - \frac{W (1-\eta) - w (3-\eta)}{(2-\eta)(W-w)} - \frac{w}{(2-\eta)(W-w)} = \\
\frac{W}{(2-\eta)(W-w)} > 0
\end{aligned}
$$
and $lim_{x-> \pm \infty}{G(x)} = +\infty$.

Therefore, one root of $G(x)$ is negative and one, $\tilde{x}$, is positive and below 1. Let $\delta=\frac{-B-\sqrt{B^2-4AC}}{2A}-\frac{-B+\sqrt{B^2-4AC}}{2A}$ (where _A_, _B_, _C_ are the coefficients of $G(x)$, defined in [@Eq:recurrenceA1B1_solution]). Then, $\delta=\frac{\sqrt{(W+w)^2-\eta(2-\eta)(W-w)^2}}{(2-\eta)(W-w)}$. Because $\eta(2-\eta)$ is maximized at 1, 
$$
(W+w)^2-\eta(2-\eta)(W-w)^2 > (
W+w)^2-(W-w)^2=4Ww  > 0
$$
so $\delta > 0$. Therefore, the positive root is:

$$
\tilde{x}=\frac{-B-\sqrt{B^2-4AC}}{2A}
$$ {#eq:recurrenceA1B1_solution_tildex}

@Fig:env_A1B1 shows $\tilde{x}$ (dashed green) compared with $x$ from iteration of [@Eq:recurrenceA1B1] (blue) and with the population mean $\pi$ ($\bar{\pi}$) in Wright-Fisher simulations (orange) for several combinations of $\eta, W, w$. All iterations started with $\bar{\pi}=0.5$; in the WF simulations, population size _N_ is 100,000, the initial population is drawn from $N(0.5, 0.05)$, and the results are based on 50 simulations per parameter set. Note that the x-axis shows **every other generation** (end of each period). The analytic approximation is good when selection is extreme ($w=0$), but overestimates $\bar{\pi}$ when selection in not extreme ($w=0.1$). In both cases the initial population distribution did not affect the results (as long as it wasn't trivial, _i.e._ $\pi=0$, see @Fig:env_A1B1_Ï€0).
