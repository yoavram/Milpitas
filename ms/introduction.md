# Introduction

Biological bet hedging is
Bet hedging was first described in
Common in nature: microbes [@Dubnau2006], mice [@Morgan1999], worms [@Serobyan2017]
Optimal bet hedging strategy [@King2007]
principle of mean geometric fitness
bet hedging genes [@Ragsdale2013]
The evolution of a bet hedging gene [@King2007] 

The inheritance mode of the bet hedging gene
@Xue2016 proposed an inheritance mechanism the distribution of phenotypes of the offspring depends on the parent's distribution as well as on the parent realized phenotype, such that the probability $\pi'_i$ for phenotype $\phi_i$ in the offspring, given the parent's probability was $\pi_i$, is $(1-\eta)\pi_i + \eta$ if the parent had phenotype $\phi_i$ and $(1-\eta)\pi_i$ otherwise, where $0 \le \eta \le 1$, the phenotype inheritance rate, is the relative effect of the parent phenotype on the offspring phenotype distribution, which can be encoded by a separate modifier gene.
This inheritance mechanism combines information both from the phenotype ($\phi_i$) and from the genotype or epigenotype ($\pi_i$); importantly, the parent phenotype modifies the offspring genotype [@Rivoire2014].

Examples: bacteria [@Veening2008b], worms [@Serobyan2013]

@Xue2016 showed that...

Other inheritance modes were suggested for bet hedging genes, 
in which the transmitted phenotype distribution is modified by factors other than the parent phenotype:

- epimutations: random unbiased modifications
- maternal effect: modifications which depends on the parent's environment [@Mousseau1998; @Rechavi2014; reviewed in @Wang2017]; evidence for modifier [@Houri-Zeevi2016]
- conformity: modifications which depend on the phenotypes of multiple individuals from the parent's environment [@Boyd1988, pg. 213]
- stress-induced: modifications are more likely when the parent is stressed [@Rechavi2014]; can be unbiased (like mutations) or biased (like parent phenotype effect) 

Different inheritance modes are predicted to be more beneficial in different conditions, and some of these predictions have been experimentally validated [@Leung2016].
