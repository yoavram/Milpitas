The figure shows the frequency of phenotype \emph{A} after \(10^6\) generations in a very large population evolving in a stochastic environment (eq.\ 31).
The fitness of phenotypes \emph{A} and \emph{B} are \(w_A=1+s_t\) and \(w_B=1\),
where \(s_t\) is \emph{s} with probability \emph{p} and \emph{-s} with probability \(1-p\).
The gray lines mark combinations of \emph{p} and \emph{s} for which \(E[\log{(1-\rho+\rho\frac{w_A}{w_B})}]=0\) and \(E[\log{(1-\rho+\rho\frac{w_B}{w_A})}]=0\).
According to Result 6, between these lines fixation of either phenotype will be stochastically locally unstable, and indeed we have a stationary polymorphism between the lines, with phenotype frequencies neither 0 or 1.
Parameters: initial frequency of \(A\) is \(x_0=1/10,000\) and the vertical transmission rate is \(\rho=0.1\).}\label{fig:stochastic_env_x_t}

As the vertical transmission rate \(\rho\) increases from 0.001 to 0.5 the frequency reaches a polymorphic distribution with \(E(x_t)\to0.5\) faster,
but the variance also increases.

\includegraphics{../figures/rho_evol_stability.pdf}
\caption{Evolutionarily stable vertical transmission rate in $AkBk$ selection regime. 
The evolutionary stable rate $\rho^*$ was determined as in Carja et al.\ (2014) using simulations of eq.\ 35: for each $k$ from 1 to 50, ten initial rates were randomly chosen between 0 and 1 for the resident modifier $m$; after the population evolved with only $m$ for 1,000 generations towards an equilibrium, invader modifier alleles $M$ were consecutively introduced at frequency $10^{-4}$; their value for $\rho$ was a product of the resident rate and a random number from an exponential distribution with a mean of 1; if an invader increased in frequency after $5,000 \times 2k$ generations, the invader was considered successful and became the resident modifier for the next invasion, and allowed to evolve for 1,000 generations to reach a new equilibrium before the next invasion; if the invader was unsuccessful, a new invader was drawn. After at least 500 invasion attempts and 50 unsuccessful ones, the evolutionary process stopped. The markers show the average for ten such processes for each $k$ value. 95\% confidence intervals (calculated with bootstrap, 1,000 resamples) are too small to be seen. The dashed line shows the relation $\rho=1-1/(k-1)$ (Carja et al. 2014), which is close to the simulation results for \(w=0.5\).
In all cases, $W=1$.}\label{fig:rho_evol_stability}
